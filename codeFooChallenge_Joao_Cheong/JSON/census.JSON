In NES Golf, players were given status prompts in an input output format. Games back then were anything but flashy, with stiff controls at best. Nevertheless, they were still considered games. Fewer genres were available before the 90s and even fewer individuals can proudly declare themselves as gamers. With the advent of Smartphones, it has become easier to discern what a gamer is."]

With the rise of games like Words with Friends, Farmville, and Pet Society, people can be considered a gamer automatically for having it cached on their phones or computers.", 
		"Now the most peculiar question is, were these people not gamers before? Is there such a difference from interacting with pixels on a screen to actually interacting with a real object? Would it not be considered a game if people played scrabble, did yard work, or groomed their dogs and cats if they were not doing it in front of a screen?",

The term, there is something for everyone, holds true as Pokemon Snap, derived from the idea of visiting foreign islands to take pictures of unique species until you reached the end of your trip or run out of film. Nintendo even hyped up the photoshooting genre with Pokemon Snap 2. Eventually, Nintendo worked on games using Augmented Reality, since taking pictures can be such a recreational activity."]

Parents, and even grandparents would not mind spending the afternoon playing tabletop games with their spouses, because it is intellectually stimulating for everyone. Monopoly and Risk were board games before they became video game titles. Even so, the experience of playing with the actual metallic hat and plastic dice is ten folds better than tapping or flicking the dices on the screen. Why should people who wish to enjoy to full experience of playing with the actual game pieces be any less of a gamer than the people who play with sprites?", 
		"Visual novels, probably not a popular word among people not familiar with Japanese culture. Visual novels are stories with role playing attributes where minimal action is required from the player. It is a picture book with lots of reading involved. It is a stretch but if visual novels can be considered games with the people reading to being gamers; why should a person reading Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings be any different if they enjoy reading. One title that cannot be overlooked is, Where is Waldo? Where is Waldo began as a book and was later ported to console and brought about many spot the difference games in the industry.",

They might not have a game console or a Smartphone, but they most likely have a computer with a hash encrypted hidden game folder. These games might not have required purchase, nor do they require an internet connection to play. Or, they may be old school classics that have fallen into near extinction with only a special few people possessing them now. In other words, these people cannot be tracked with gaming polls.",
